# Hello, I'm Pankaj Kumar

I've recently discovered that I have free will. It is a wild realisation. I can use the skills I've gathered over time to actually *build* and *create* real things, even if for purely personal projects. I had glimpses of this during my PhD. Visions of personal agency. Much like how I can step into a kitchen and cook whatever I am craving, I can do the same in all things. It sounds silly but this has been a real shift in my perspective and has encouraged me to be more active in building, sharing, and exploring further.

My PhD at Cambridge focused on applying NLP and LLMs in Engineering Materials Science, building on my academic background of Physics and Scientific Computing. In my spare time, however, my curiosity truly takes the lead. I might find myself looking for reasons to factory reset my computer just to test various Linux distributions, or ricing my setup to perfectly balance aesthetics with a streamlined workflow. Other times, I dive into optimizing seemingly small details – like developing a genetic algorithm to find my ideal keyboard layout, or going further still by designing, printing the PCB for, and soldering every component of a mechanical keyboard entirely from scratch. More recently, I’ve been focused on the capabilities of frontier AI. While I’ve built custom image generation workflows and experimented with music generation, my primary focus is now on developing AI Agents using the latest LLMs.

I'm keen to talk, brainstorm, and potentially collaborate with people who are turning ideas into reality (or who mayhaps also love getting lost in slightly irreverent rambles exploring tech, creative sparks, and whatever grand notions find us). I'm always open to meeting new people so please do get in touch! :>
