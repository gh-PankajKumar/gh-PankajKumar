    Hello, I'm Pankaj Kumar.
  </h1>

  <p style="font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.7; color: #2f363d; margin-bottom: 25px;">
    I've recently discovered that I have free will. It is a wild realisation. I can use the skills I've gathered over time to actually <em>build</em> and <em>create</em> real things, even if for purely personal projects. I had glimpses of this during my PhD. Visions of personal agency. Much like how I can step into a kitchen and cook whatever I am craving, I can do the same in all things. It sounds silly but this has been a real shift in my perspective and has encouraged me to be more active in building, sharing, and exploring further .

    I am now making the most of my time

    While my PhD at Cambridge (focused on applying NLP and LLMs in Engineering Materials Science) provided a strong foundation and a starting point, it's this visceral experience of hands-on building, sparked by this newfound 'freedom', that's currently my <strong>main driving force</strong>.

  <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.7; color: #484f58; margin-bottom: 35px;">
    I'm incredibly excited to continue down this path of creating, tinkering, and exploring what's possible. I'm now looking forward to building more and am starting to think about sharing some of these creations with the wider world.

      I'm keen to talk, brainstorm, and potentially collaborate with people who are turning ideas into reality (or who mayhaps also love getting lost in slightly irreverent rambles exploring tech, creative sparks, and whatever grand notions find us). I'm always open to meeting new people so please do get in touch! :>
