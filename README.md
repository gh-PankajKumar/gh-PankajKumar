<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Pankaj Kumar</h1>  
<h3 align="center">I am a PhD graduate from the University of Cambridge specialising in Natural Language Processing and Language Models. My research focused on the application of these tools for Engineering Materials Science to help facilitate the shift towards the "fourth paradigm" of research (fancy way of saying data-driven). </h3>  

<h3 align="center">I am a person who loves to be constantly learning, and as such, I am interested in the application of the latest tools and technology in areas I may not be familiar with. In this way, I can learn about the world around us while providing meaningful contributions to tackle real-world challenges.  </h3>
